**- If you want to contribute to Kernel Simulator, the conditions below must be followed:**

1. If you want to modify/recode the core kernel, make sure that you write the changes correctly and carefully, making sure that you don't
   damage the core kernel features.
2. If you want to add/modify/remove/recode some desired features everywhere, Write the changes carefully.
3. Like every other developers that wants to contribute to Kernel Simulator, the changes must be tested. We don't want the results, only test,
   and say that it is tested. If you want to provide the results, we still accept your pull request.
4. If you haven't tested it, and you sent us pull request, we will test the code and if we find that:

   - your code is working, we will accept your pull request
   - your code is not working, we will close your pull request

5. If you haven't tested it, and you are ready to send us, test the code first.
6. If you want to modify the documentation, or other parts other than coding, or add parts of/new documentation, feel free to. You can notify us.


**- Porting to other operating systems or programming languages that is _other_ than Assembly (ASM, NASM, ...) or C/C++ language:**

You might have to port Kernel Simulator into other operating system such as Linux, macOS, and so on. And also, to another programming languages that
is other than C/C++ or Assembly language. 


**- If you want to port Kernel Simulator to _Linux_ on Visual Basic (untested):**

1. Use appropriate Visual Basic Compiler for Linux, like Mono. http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/languages/visualbasic/
2. Make changes as necessary, and test (compile) the code.


**- If you want to port Kernel Simulator to macOS (untested):**

(Please contribute, any Mac contributors)


Note: If you want to port Kernel Simulator to another programming languages that doesn't equal Assembly or C/C++, feel free to.
Note: Porting Kernel inside the Kernel Simulator to the Real Computer/VirtualBox using Assembly and C/C++ is based on **poll**, and the **owner's decision**.
